# Lyric Rhyme Analyzer
## Overview

The Lyric Rhyme Analyzer is a simple web app built with Streamlit that fetches song lyrics from the Genius API and analyzes the rhyming patterns in the lyrics. It highlights rhyming words in different colors and displays groups of rhyming words, making it easy to see the structure and patterns in song lyrics. <br>
This was inspired by Genius' Highlighted series, where this highlighting is done by professional musicians and rap connoisseurs.
